# Resol Dashboard Webinterface

## Goals :rocket:

The goal of this repositories is to design and write a Webinterface for a
small Webserver running on a Raspberry Pi, that has data about a heating unite from the Company RESOL stored.

## Requierements

This Interface has to be ...

1. lightweight, because of the hardware constraints of the Raspberry Pi
2. adaptible, because there are many features to be implemented
3.

## Features

The Interface should have a

1. dashboard with custom Cards to quickly have a overview of the current state
2. feature, to query the specific data from a specific timeframe and view it in a visual representation or as a table
3. feature, to be able to download data from a timeframe
4. feature, to be able to overlay to datasets to view the differentes

## Current State

This Project is in its beginning Stages, this means that I'm still in the designing phase. The Current Design progress can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/5tuakfmCbXPedYCt1NRNSM/Resol_Dasboard_Webinterface?t=F7zy1z78MEEAwdY5-1).

I will add more project structure one I'm happy with the first iteration of my design

## Disclamer

This is not the repository will **not** contain the Webserver, because i want to keep it small and I don't want to revel any personal information. When i finidh this project i will pulish a version whih anyone can customise for them selfs, but that will take some time.
